# Dog Breed Reveal: Dog Image Classification
Can you tell a dog’s breed just by looking at them? With so many breeds out there, it can even be hard to pinpoint the breed of a pure-bred dog, let alone mutts. Wouldn’t it be fun to snap a picture of a dog and immediately know it’s breed and typical traits? Such a tool would be especially helpful to dog adoption organizations (or a regular dog enthusiast who likes meeting dogs off the street, like me!). In this project I use a Kaggle dataset of over 10,000 dog photos spanning 120 breeds to create a classifier to determine a dog’s breed from an image. During this process I use image augmentation and transfer learning to define three CNN models that contain the same layers, but have different numbers of classes. I first define a 12-breed classifier, then increase to 30 breeds, and finally all 120 breeds. The 30-breed model performed well and is the focus of the project.
